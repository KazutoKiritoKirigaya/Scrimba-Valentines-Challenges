# Valentine's Greeting

## Task:

### Wire up the app so that the greeting is updated with each change of the Form.

### Stretch goals:

### Only display "from" when the sender field is filled in.

### Allow the user to add in a custom greeting.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
```

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
one of our paid courses

-   [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
-   [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
-   [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

    It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.

Happy Coding!
